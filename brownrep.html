    <p class="centertext" style="font-family:'Courier New'"><b>slogan: spectra represent cohomology theories.</b></p><br><br>
    <p class="centertext"> Much of this talk is based on Brown's original 1961 paper, <a style = "background-color: #80800080; color:black" href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/brown3.pdf"><i>Cohomology Theories.</i></a> I first motivate spectra as a fundamental object of study. Then, I demonstrate how to get a cohomology theory given a spectrum. Finally, and this is where we spend most of our efforts, I construct a spectrum given a cohomology theory.</p>
    <p class="centertext"> This talk is aimed at those familiar with algebraic topology but not homotopy theory. I assume as little as possible and go at a relatively leisurely pace.  </p>

    <h2>I. Spectra</h2>
    <p>Take \(X\) to be a pointed path-connected space with the structure of a CW-complex. </p>
    <p><b>Vague question.</b> What are the dimension-independent properties of \(X\)?</p>
    <p>To make sense of this question, we need a generalization of \(X\) that provides some space in "each dimension" which preserve the relevant structure of \(X\). In particular, we need to decide what "relavant structure" means.</p>
    <h3> preserving homology: suspension & stability</h3>
    <p>
        A candidate for the "relavant structure" is homology, which is preserved under taking suspensions: we have isomorphisms
        $$\tilde{H}_{k+1}(\Sigma X) \xrightarrow{\sim} \tilde{H}_{k}(X)$$
        in reduced homology, coming from Mayer-Vietoris by viewing suspension as gluing together two cones (recall cones are contractible.) Taking the \(k\)-suspension of \(X\) simply shifts the indices of the homology groups by \(k\),
        so homology is essentially invariant under suspension.
    </p>
    <p id="susspecdef"><b>Definition.</b> A <i >suspension spectrum</i> is a sequence of spaces \(\{X_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\) with <i>structure maps</i>
    $$\Sigma X_i \xrightarrow{\sim} X_{i+1}$$
    which are isomorphisms.
    </p>
    <p>
        How much structure does this invariance of homology groups force? The natural next thing to wonder is whether homotopy groups are also invariant under suspension. Clearly this isn't true on the nose: \(S^k = \Sigma^{k-1}S^1\), and homotopy groups of spheres are not so simple.
        But homotopy groups <i>are</i> invariant under certain connectedness conditions:
    </p>
    <p id="freudenthal">
        <b>Freudenthal suspension theorem. </b> Suppose \(X\) is \(n\)-connected. The map $$X \rightarrow \Omega \Sigma X$$
        <img src="img/brownrep1.png" class="center" alt="demonstration of the map X -> loops of suspension of X"> 
        induces the map
        $$f_k: \pi_k(X) \rightarrow \pi_k(\Omega \Sigma X) \simeq \pi_{k+1}(\Sigma X)$$
        where the last isomorphism is given by the suspension-loop adjunction. Then \(f_k\) is an isomorphism for \(k \leq 2n\) and an epimorphism for \(k = 2n+1\).
    </p>
    <p>This theorem is a direct consequence of <a href="https://math.colorado.edu/~agbe5088/math6280/classnotes/Daniel_Martin.pdf" style="color:black; background-color:#80800080"><i>homotopy excision</i></a>.</p>
    <div class="proof">Take \(\Sigma X = (CX)^+ \cup (CX)^-\), the decomposition of the suspension into reduced cones that intersect at \(X\). We will apply homotopy excision to 
        $$ ((CX)_{+},X)\subset (\Sigma X,(CX)_{-}).$$ 
        <img src="img/brownrep2.png" class="center" alt="homotopy excision cones">
        Notice that since \(X\) is \(n\)-connected, by the long exact sequence in relative homotopy, \(((CX)_{+},X)\) and \(((CX)_{-},X)\)
        are \((n+1)\)-connected as cones are contractible. Then homotopy excision says that 
        $$g_k: \pi_k((CX)_{+},X) \rightarrow \pi_k(\Sigma X,(CX)_{-})$$
        is an isomorphism for \(k < 2n+2\) and a surjection for \(k = 2n+2.\)</p>
        <p>Also, by the long exact sequence in relative homotopy, we have isomorphisms
            $$\pi_k((CX)_{+},X) \xrightarrow{\sim} \pi_{k-1}(X)$$
            and since cones are contractible, \(\pi_k(\Sigma X,(CX)_{-}) = \pi_k(\Sigma X).\) Substituting back into \(g_k\) we have the desired isomorphisms/surjection.
        </p>
        <p>(You can work through the homotopy excision and the suspension-loop adjunction explicitly to see \(g_k\) is the same map as \(f_k\).) </p></div>

    <p>Unfortunately, if \(X\) doesn't start out very well-connected, this theorem doesn't say much. But recall that taking suspensions raises the connectivity: the first nonzero homotopy group is also 
        the first nonzero homology group, and taking suspension shifts the indices of the homology groups by one, so if \(X\) is \(n\)-connected, then \(\Sigma X\) must be \((n+1)\)-connected, and \(\Sigma^k X\) is \((n+k)\)-connected.
        As we keep on taking higher and higher suspensions, more and more homotopy groups stay the same, and we can make the following definition.
    </p>
    <p><b>Definition.</b> The \(i\)-th stable homotopy group of \(X\) is $$\pi_i^s(X) = \lim_n \pi_{n+i}(\Sigma^i X).$$</p>
    <p>(Note: this is a colimit in the category of abelian groups.)</p>

    <h3>preserving homotopy: \(\Omega\)-spectra</h3>
    <p> What if, instead, we took the "relevant structure" to mean directly that the homotopy groups are preserved? In other words, we wonder whether there is a sequence of spaces \(\{X_i\}_{i\in \mathbb{Z}}\) such that
        \(X_0=X\) and $$ \pi_k(X_i) = \pi_{k+1}(X_{i+1}).$$
        
        We may rewrite this condition on homotopy groups by using the suspension-loop adjunction, as
        $$\pi_k(X_i)=[S^k,X_i] = [S^{k+1}, X_{i+1}] \simeq [S^k, \Omega X_{i+1}] = \pi_k(\Omega X_{i+1}).$$
        At this point, we may be tempted to try to find \(X_{n+1}\) iteratively so that \(X_n = \Omega X_{n+1}\). Unfortunately, not all spaces can be de-looped; see May's treatise on operads, <a style="color:black; background-color: #80800080;" href="https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/BOOKS/gils.pdf"><i>The Geometry of Iterated Loop Spaces.</i></a>
        Instead we settle for just requiring weak equivalences:
    </p>
    <p id="omegspecdef"><b>Definition.</b> An \(\Omega\)<i>-spectrum</i> is a sequence of spaces \(\{X_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\) with weak equivalences
        $$X_i \rightarrow \Omega X_{i+1}.$$
        </p>
    <p>It is a priori unclear that given \(X\), there is a \(\Omega\)-spectrum where \(X_0=X\). But actually there is, by the construction in <a style="color:#C04000" href="#specfromcoh"><b>section IV</b>.</a>  </p>
    <p><b>Example.</b> Our favorite example of spaces with simple homotopy groups are Eilenberg-Maclane spaces \(K(G,n)\), whose only nontrivial homotopy group
    is \(\pi_n(K(G,n)) = G\). Then fixing \(G\), \(K(G,-)\) gives an \(\Omega\)-spectrum.</p>

    <h3>general notions of spectra: first steps</h3>
    Somehow, we want <a style="color:#c04000" href="#susspecdef"><b>suspension spectra</b></a> and <a style="color:#c04000" href="#omegspecdef"><b>\(\Omega\)-spectra</b></a> to be instances of the same object, a generalization of spaces. They're clearly not instances of one another (think about \(K(\mathbb{Z},1) = S^1\)) but they do share some 
    similarities:
    <ul>
        <li>both have spaces \(\{X_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\) in their data;</li>
        <li>both have structure maps that are based on suspension: for suspension spectra, the structure maps are isomorphisms
            $$\Sigma X_i \xrightarrow{\sim} X_{i+1}$$ whereas for \(\Omega\)-spectra, the suspension-loop adjunction give maps
            $$\Sigma X_i \rightarrow X_{i+1}$$ adjoint to weak equivalences;
        </li>
        <li>
            both have a notion of stable homotopy groups: by <a href="#freudenthal" style="color:#C04000"><b>Freudenthal suspension</b></a> they stabilize for suspension spectra,
            and by definition homotopy groups are invariant for \(\Omega\)-spectra.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Motivated by this, we make the following preliminary definitions.</p>
    <p><b>Definition.</b> A <i>(CW-)spectrum</i> consists of a sequence \(\{X_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\) of pointed CW-complexes with structure maps 
    \(\Sigma X_i \rightarrow X_{i+1}\).</p>
    <p><b>Definition.</b> The <i>homotopy groups</i> of a spectrum \(X=\{X_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\) is the colimit
    $$\pi_n(X) = \lim_n \pi_{n+i}(X_i)$$
    in the category of abelian groups, where the maps \(\pi_k(X_i) \rightarrow \pi_{k+1}(X_{i+1})\) are defined by factoring through:
    <img src="img/brownrep3.png" class="centerpad" alt="commutative diagram of factoring">
    </p>

    <p>We will revisit the general notion of spectra in <a href="#catref" style="color:#C04000"><b>section V</b></a>. For now, it suffices to focus on \(\Omega\)-spectra.</p>

    

    <h2>II. Cohomology Theories</h2>
    <p>Let \(\mathcal{C}\) be the category of CW-pairs, and \(\mathbf{Ab}\) the category of abelian groups. Recall the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms:</p>
    <p><b>Definition.</b> A <i>generalized cohomology theory</i> consists of functors \(H^q:\mathcal{C}^{op} \rightarrow \mathbf{Ab}\) for \(q \in \mathbb{Z}\) with a collection of natural isomorphisms \(\partial: H^q(A) \rightarrow H^{q+1}(X,A)\) satisfying
        <ul>
            <li>(<i>homotopy</i>) if \(f,g:(X,A) \rightarrow (Y,B)\) are homotopic, then \(H^q(f) = H^q(g).\)</li>
            <li>(<i>exactness</i>) for inclusions \(i: (X,\{x_0\}) \hookrightarrow (X,A)\) and \(j:A \hookrightarrow X\) the following sequence is exact:
            $$\cdots \rightarrow H^{q-1}(A) \xrightarrow{\partial} H^q(X,A) \xrightarrow{H^q(i)} H^q(X) \xrightarrow{H^q(j)} H^q(A) \rightarrow \cdots$$</li>
            <li>(<i>excision</i>) for pairs \((X_1, X_1\cap X_2)\) and \((X_2, X_1\cap X_2)\) we have isomorphism
                $$H^q(X_1\cup X_2, X_2) \xrightarrow{\sim} H^q(X_1, X_1 \cap X_2)$$ induced by the inclusion.</li>
            <li>(<i>additivity</i>) if \(U\) is a space with discrete topology and \(i: \{p\} \hookrightarrow U\), we have
            $$\prod_{p \in U}H^q(i):H^q(U) \xrightarrow{\sim} \prod_{p \in U} H^q(p).$$
            For sequence of subcomplexes \(X_1 \subseteq X_2 \subseteq X_3 \subseteq \cdots\) where \(X = \bigcup_{n}X_n,\) the inclusions induce epimorphism
            $$H^q(X) \rightarrow \varprojlim H^q(X^n).$$
        </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Examples.</b> Beyond the ordinary cohomology theories, \(K\)-theory and cobordism are also cohomology theories.</p>

    <p>The motivating example for the main theorem is the fact that for ordinary cohomology, \(H^q(X, G) \simeq [X, K(G,n)]\). If you're
        unfamiliar with this fact, I quite like the first chapter of <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/moshtang.pdf" style="color:black;background-color: #80800080;"><i>Cohomology Operations and Applications in Homotopy Theory</i></a> by Mosher and Tangora.
    </p>

    <p><b>Brown Representability Theorem.</b> If \(\{H^q, \partial\}\) is a cohomology theory, there is an \(\Omega\)-spectrum \(Y=\{Y_q\}\) such that 
    there is a natural isomorphism $$T^q:[-,Y_q] \xrightarrow{\sim} H^q$$ such that \(\partial T^q = T^{q+1} \partial.\)</p>
    

    <h2>III. Cohomology Theories from Spectra</h2>
    <p>Given an \(\Omega\)-spectrum \(Y = \{Y_q\}\), we show \([-,Y_q]\) specifies a cohomology theory. The boundary \(\partial\) is defined as follows: take 
        $$f: \Sigma (X,A) \rightarrow (A,x_0)$$
        <img src="img/brownrep4.jpeg" class="center2" alt="contract X\A to basepoint and project \Sigma A to A">
        which induces a map 
        $$[A,Y_q] \xrightarrow{f_*} [\Sigma (X,A), Y_q]$$
        which, by the suspension-loop adjunction, gives
        $$\partial: [A,Y_q] \rightarrow [(X,A), Y_{q+1}].$$
    </p>
    <p>Now we show \(\{[-,Y_q], \partial\}\) is a cohomology theory by checking the axioms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>(homotopy)</i> this is clear since we're looking at homotopy classes of maps;</li>
        <li><i>(exactness)</i> notice that \([(A,B),(Y_q,\{y_q\})]\) consists of maps which collapse \(B\) to a point, so it is equivalent to \([A/B, Y_q]\).</li> 
        <li><i>(excision)</i> the isomorphism follows from the equivalent of spaces
        $$(X_1 \cup X_2)/X_2 \simeq X_1 / (X_1 \cap X_2).$$</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="specfromcoh">IV. Spectra from Cohomology Theories</h2>

    <h2 id="catref">V. Categorical Reformulation</h2>
    <p>At this point, we want to say the sentence "cohomology theories are representable functors."</p>
